## Description

The Bosch Sensortec BME280, BME680 and BME688 sensor system brings a wide range of accurate sensor facilities in small, efficient packages.  This library helps tap into the power offered by these devices without requiring a large investment in time and resources. The lirbary provides simple controls to enable quick turn around for a project.

### Facilities

The library facilitates the connection and control of any of the BME280, BME680 and BME688 devices and provides simple interfaces for measuring temperature, pressurere, humidity and precision gas detection, depending on your chosen device.

### Connections

Designed to use either I2C or SPI bus, this software provides simple connectivity methods to get you up and running quickly. The I2C connection requries 2 pins - serial data and serial clock. The SPI connection requires 4 pins - chip select, serial in, serial out and serial clock. Both implementations additionally required Vcc and GND.

### Datasheets

The datasheets of the devices that are supported can be found below:
